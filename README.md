ABSTRACT: Here we introduce CBGTPy, a virtual environment for designing and testing goal-directed agents with internal dynamics that are modeled off of the cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) pathways in the mammalian brain, including a physiologically-realistic implementation of dopamine-driven synaptic plasticity. CBGTPy enables researchers to investigate the internal dynamics of the CBGT system during a variety of tasks, allowing for the formation of testable predictions about animal behavior and neural activity. The framework has been designed around the principle of flexibility, such that many experimental parameters in a decision-making paradigm can be easily defined and modified. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of CBGTPy across a range of single and multi-choice tasks, highlighting the ease of set up and the biologically realistic behavior that it produces. We show that CBGTPy is extensible enough to apply to a wide range of experimental protocols and to allow for the implementation of model extensions with minimal developmental effort.
